## Submitting a pull request

The type of change you make will dictate what repositories you will need to make pull requests for. You can reach out to us on our [**Slack**](https://join.slack.com/t/getolake/shared_invite/zt-2usyz3i6r-8I8c9MtfcQUINQbR7vNtCQ/) channel if you have any questions.

For example to contribute a new ui component, you need to create a pull request (PR). Follow these steps to ensure your PR is well-prepared:
- Provide a clear and concise PR title.
- Write a detailed and descriptive PR description.
- Request a code review from the maintainers.

## Committing

We prefer squash or rebase commits so that all changes from a branch are committed to master as a single commit. All pull requests are squashed when merged, but rebasing prior to merge gives you better control over the commit message. Only signed commits are accepted for contribution.
